Description: Implements an extension of the Chacko chi-square test for
    ordered vectors (Chacko, 1966, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/25051572>).
    Our extension brings the Chacko test to the computer age by implementing
    a permutation test to offer a numeric estimate of the p-value, which is
    particularly useful when the analytic solution is not available.
