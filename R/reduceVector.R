# Notice that Chacko was entirely comfortable with this ordering process
# ending with a single value. If you look at their table on page 188 then he
# suggests that under the null hypothesis â€“ if you start with a list of 5
# values, then you have a 20% chance that this process that the order process
# results in a single value.

#' @title Reduce a vector using the ordering process
#' @description This function implements the ordering process described in
#' Chacko (1963) and Chacko (1966).
#' @param x a vector of numeric values
#' @param verbosity a natural number indicating the amount of output to print
#' @return A list containing the original vector, the reduced vector, their
#' weights and the number of reductions performed. Use [names()] and [str()]
#' on the output for more details.
