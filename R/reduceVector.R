# Notice that Chacko was entirely comfortable with this ordering process
# ending with a single value. If you look at their table on page 188 then he
# suggests that under the null hypothesis â€“ if you start with a list of 5
# values, then you have a 20% chance that this process that the order process
# results in a single value.

#' @title Reduce a vector using the ordering process
#' @description This function implements the ordering process described in
#' Chacko (1963) and Chacko (1966).
#' @param x a vector of numeric values
#' @param verbosity a natural number indicating the amount of output to print
#' @return A matrix with two columns: the first one is the reduced vector and
#' the second one is its weight
